Implement DHCPv4
Objectives
Part 1: Configure a Router as a DHCP Server

Part 2: Configure DHCP Relay

Part 3: Configure a Router as a DHCP Client

Scenario
As the network technician for your company, you are tasked with configuring a Cisco router as a DHCP server to provide dynamic allocation of addresses to clients on the network. You are also required to configure the edge router as a DHCP client so that it receives an IP address from the ISP network. Since the server is centralized, you will need to configure the two LAN routers to relay DHCP traffic between the LANs and the router that is serving as the DHCP server.
